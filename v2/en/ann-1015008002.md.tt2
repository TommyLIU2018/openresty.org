[% major_ver = "1.15.8"; version = major_ver _ ".2" %]
OpenResty [% version %] is a patch release addressing security vulnerabilities
in the HTTP/2 protocol which may cause excessive memory consumption and CPU
usage (CVE-2019-9511, CVE-2019-9513, CVE-2019-9516).

All previous NGINX cores supporting HTTP/2 are affected by this issue (1.9.5 to
1.16.1). If you are serving HTTP/2 traffic with _any_ previous OpenResty
release, upgrade to [% version %] or disable HTTP/2.

[Download this version here](download.html).

The (portable) source code distribution, the Win32/Win64 binary
distributions, and the pre-built binary Linux packages for Ubuntu,
Debian, Fedora, CentOS, RHEL, Amazon Linux are provided on this
[Download page](download.html).

This is the second OpenResty release based on the nginx [% major_ver %] core.

# Acknowledgments
