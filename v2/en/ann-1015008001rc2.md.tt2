# Acknowledgments

Special thanks go to all our developers and contributors! Also thanks Thibault Charbonnier
for his great help in preparing this release.

# Version highlights

The highlights of this release candidate are:

* We now load `resty.core` by default in ngx_lua and ngx_stream_lua. This behavior can be disabled with the new [lua_load_resty_core](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#lua_load_resty_core) directive. Note that the `resty.core` implementation is both safer and faster, but also required for complete ARM64 support.
